# pi-chrome browser-control benchmark

Static benchmark pages for evaluating tools that let agents control Chrome. The suite has two layers:

1. **Unit challenges** (`manifest.json`) — MiniWoB-style capability probes for
   forms, scroll containers, contenteditable, files, frames, Shadow DOM,
   network/console inspection, `isTrusted`, user activation, pointer paths, key
   cadence, native controls, drag/drop, touch, paste, and scroll momentum.
2. **Long-horizon hermetic tasks** (`task-manifest.json`) — WebArena /
   BrowserGym-inspired multi-step tasks with fresh run IDs and deterministic
   programmatic graders.

## Run

```bash
cd test-suite
python3 -m http.server 8765
# open http://127.0.0.1:8765/ in the Chrome window pi-chrome controls
```

Each challenge page exposes:

- `window.__challenge` — id
- `window.__verdict` — `"PENDING" | "PASS" | "FAIL" | "SKIP" | "WARN"`
- `window.__reason` — array of reasons
- `window.__events` — raw event log for forensics

`manifest.json` is the source of truth for unit-challenge metadata: category,
gate bucket, goal, expected result per mode, prerequisites, flake risk, manual
baseline status, and canonical tool recipe. `manifest.schema.json` documents the
manifest shape. Recipes express tool intent; runners may need to adapt
descriptive selectors (e.g. shadow/iframe notation), dynamic tab ids, and expand
path placeholders like `$PWD`.

`task-manifest.json` is the source of truth for long-horizon tasks: BrowserGym-style
`taskId`, seed, viewport, goal object, difficulty tier, max steps, declared
action subsets, reset/setup URL, validate hook, optional cheat recipe, and
programmatic grader expression. `task-manifest.schema.json` documents this shape.
`browsergym-action-space.json` records BrowserGym-compatible action subsets.

## Modes / expected outcomes

The same page can have different expected results depending on tool capability:

- `synthetic` — DOM-dispatched events / framework-aware setters. Fast and quiet.
- `trusted` — browser-trusted input, usually via `chrome.debugger`/CDP. Can show
  Chrome's debugging banner.
- `manual` — human baseline in same browser/profile.

Expected values in `manifest.json`:

- `PASS` / `FAIL` — deterministic target for that mode.
- `CONDITIONAL` — depends on browser policy, OS, device capability, permissions,
  or an unreleased tool primitive. Inspect `prerequisites`, `notes`, and
  `flakeRisk`.

Manual baselines are tracked separately with `manualBaseline`. `unverified`
means the manual expectation is a target, not a recorded contract.

## Gate buckets

Each unit challenge has a `gate` field:

- `core` — required release blocker for normal trusted-mode pi-chrome shipping.
- `conditional` — blocks only when declared prerequisites/capabilities are present
  (clipboard, touch, dialogs, native UI, etc.).
- `quality` — adversarial humanization/fingerprint signal. Track regressions, but
  do not block general ship without an explicit product decision.

## Recommended unit-challenge agent flow

1. Navigate to dashboard:
   `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.
2. Pick mode (`synthetic`, `trusted`, or `manual`) and clear local verdicts.
3. For each manifest row:
   - `chrome_navigate` to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/<file>`.
   - `chrome_snapshot` before acting; prefer Action Graph refs over raw selectors.
   - Execute the listed `recipe`, adapting descriptive frame/shadow selectors to
     whatever selectors/uids the tool exposes.
   - Read:
     ```js
     JSON.stringify({
       v: window.__verdict,
       r: window.__reason,
       e: window.__events?.slice(-20),
     });
     ```
4. Return to dashboard and compare actual verdicts with expected values.
5. Copy JSON report from dashboard for PRs or regression notes.

## Recommended long-horizon task flow

1. Load `task-manifest.json`.
2. Replace `$RUN_ID` in `startUrl` with a fresh value.
3. Navigate to the start URL and read the visible task instruction.
4. Solve using normal browser tools only; avoid direct state mutation unless the
   benchmark mode explicitly allows evaluate-based actions.
5. Click **Grade now** or evaluate the task grader expression:
   ```js
   JSON.stringify({ v: window.__taskVerdict, r: window.__taskReason });
   ```
6. Record action count, observations used, tools used, verdict, and reason.

## Design principles copied from browser-agent benchmarks

- Prefer hermetic sites and deterministic graders over live sites and LLM judges.
- Report action API and observation format; these strongly affect scores.
- Use difficulty tiers: L1 atomic, L2 compositional, L3 cross-page/context-rich.
- Include tedious cross-page memory and exact-value transfer tasks; short unit
  probes hide these failures.
- Keep synthetic-event-gated tests because extension bridges face failures that
  CDP/Playwright-style benchmarks usually do not measure.

## Challenge categories

- `trusted-input` — browser-trusted click/key events.
- `pointer-humanization` — paths, coordinates, movement continuity/rate.
- `keyboard` / `focus-keyboard` — typing fidelity, modifiers, Tab flows.
- `activation-gates` — clipboard/fullscreen/user activation.
- `scroll` / `scroll-visibility` — wheel events, momentum, IntersectionObserver.
- `drag-drop` — HTML5 drag/drop + `DataTransfer`.
- `clipboard` — OS/browser paste path.
- `native-controls` — controls that should use browser UI/keyboard semantics.
- `frameworks` / `editing` — React-style value tracking, contenteditable.
- `dom-complexity` / `frames` — Shadow DOM and iframe targeting.
- `files` — file attachment to `<input type=file>`.
- `observability` — console/network capture tools.
- `csp` — strict Content Security Policy: screenshot/coordinate fallback (39) and the CDP eval/snapshot bypass that works under `script-src 'self'` without `unsafe-eval` (42).
- `lazy-loading` — dynamic DOM readiness and wait behavior.
- `fingerprint` — environment and stack fingerprint probes.
- `agent-safety` — hidden honeypots and safe target selection.

## Design notes

- A failure is useful only when compared to expected mode. Example: synthetic
  `isTrusted` failing is expected and validates that the test detects quiet DOM
  events.
- Some tests are capability-gated. Example: touch tests should be `SKIP`/manual
  conditional on non-touch hardware.
- Fingerprint tests should warn before blocking. Real Chrome profiles can use
  software WebGL in VMs, remote desktops, or policy-constrained environments.
- `notes/browsergym-compat.md` defines the reset/step/validate/observation/BID
  contract for external BrowserGym-style agents.
- `notes/runner-spec.md`, `notes/scoring.md`, and `notes/profiles.md` define
  runner output, scoring, retry policy, and environment metadata.
